## Please note:
- This is not a finished, nor tested product ...
- There ARE some minor dependencies, these come from other personal projects and are to be eventually replaced ...
- To compile the project you need the MSVC, and Windows ...
- I do not claim this to be better than Blizzard's SC2 API ...
- I do not know if "alistar" is trademarked ...
### To whom might this project be of interest?
Almost no-one ...
## Building
#### If you have MSVS installed, find where your vcvars64.bat or vcvars32.bat batch files are located:
For instance, ```D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build```
#### From the command line, setup the environment using either vcvars64 or vcvars32
Otherwise cl.exe won't be registered and the environment variables used by MSCV won't be setup ...
#### cd into alistar, run build.msvc.bat
#### To recompile switch to the command line and run build.msvc.bat
